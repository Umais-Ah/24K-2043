Problem: Implement an algorithm for determining if
an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor
of 6).If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd
number as well.

1. Ask user to enter the “N”
2. Ask user to enter the “n”
3. Check if Nth is a divisor of n:
 .If N % n==0, PRINT “N is divisor of n”
 .Else, PRINT, “Please enter valid number”
4. Now check if divisor is even or odd
 .If N % 2 == 0, PRINT “number is even”
 .else, PRINT “number is odd”
